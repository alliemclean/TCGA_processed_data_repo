# TCGA_processed_data_repo
Thank you for agreeing to participate in our panel interview. Our goal in this meeting is to learn more about how you approach your work. To that end, we have prepared a dataset of two subtypes of breast cancer (Luminal A and Luminal B) for you to analyze and classify. Please note: this comparison has historically been a difficult classification problem for investigators. The files are located here:  https://github.com/alliemclean/TCGA_processed_data_repo 
The dataset consists of expression data from TCGA of 60,433 genes annotations for 311 patients and a table of the corresponding cancer type for each sample. The raw gene-level counts have been generated but have not been filtered or normalized.  Please prepare a presentation for your analysis of the dataset that includes your thoughts on and results for the following: 
* Filtering and normalization approaches to the raw count data 
* A brief outline of the approach you would take for pre-processing raw sequencing data. 
* The use of any dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. 
* Would you use any clustering or unsupervised learning approaches on the dataset?  
* The application of any supervised learning to the dataset. Report any relevant classification metrics.  
* Additional steps or other directions for the analysis.  
You may use any programming language that you are comfortable with. We will give you 15-20 minutes to present your results and the rest of the time will be used for questions and conversation. We expect that you will spend a maximum of about 5 hours on the analysis, with another 1-2 hours to structure your thoughts, generate any figures/tables, and prepare your presentation before the interview call. 
There may not be a single best answer, and we are not looking for a “correct” answer. We are interested in seeing how you think about data and data analysis, as well as how you develop and communicate your recommendations. Please be ready to explain your rationale for any choices or assumptions made in your analysis.  
If you have any questions about the assignment, please feel free to reach out to me and I would be happy to answer. We understand that this is a significant ask on our part for your time, and we want you to feel prepared.
